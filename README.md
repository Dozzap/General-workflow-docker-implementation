# General Workflow Docker Implementation

This repository provides a modular, Docker-based workflow composed primarily of Python components. It contains services and scripts for tasks including text censoring, compression, conversion, profanity detection, and text-to-speech synthesis.



## Directory Structure (Partial)

- `Censor/` - Contains code or resources related to text or media censoring.
- `Compression/` - Handles data compression functionalities.
- `Conversion/` - Contains code for data or media conversion.
- `Profanity-Detection/` - Implements profanity detection logic.
- `Text2Speech/` - Provides text-to-speech conversion features.
- `.gitignore` - Specifies files/folders to be ignored by Git.
- `docker-compose.yml` - Defines multi-container Docker applications for the workflow.
- `pipeline.py` - Python script orchestrating the workflow steps.
- `final_output.wav` - Example or output audio file.
- `prev_censor.txt` - (Empty or placeholder text file; purpose to be clarified).

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- Docker and Docker Compose installed.
- Python 3.x (for manual execution or development outside Docker).

### Running the Workflow

To bring up the workflow services using Docker Compose:

```bash
docker-compose up --build
